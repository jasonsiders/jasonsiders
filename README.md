Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm [@jasonsiders](https://github.com/jasonsiders). 

I'm a 5x certified Salesforce Developer with nearly 6 years of experience crafting elegant, scalable solutions on the Salesforce platform. My background includes working across diverse professional settings, including in-house roles, consulting, and open-source projects.

Iâ€™m a self-taught technologist who broke into the industry through dedication and self-study, eventually landing an internal role at my company. Since then, Iâ€™ve continued to grow, using my skills to help companies solve complex challenges. Iâ€™m just as comfortable engaging with people as I am with technology, and Iâ€™m passionate about delivering solutions that make an impact.
