Hi! 👋 I'm [@jasonsiders](https://github.com/jasonsiders). 

I'm a 6x certified Salesforce Developer with 6 years of experience crafting elegant, scalable solutions on the Salesforce platform. My background includes working across diverse professional settings, including in-house roles, consulting, and open-source projects. Currently, I ply my trade at [Nasuni](https://www.nasuni.com/).

I’m a self-taught technologist who broke into the industry through dedication and self-study, eventually landing an internal role at my company. Since then, I’ve continued to grow, using my skills to help companies solve complex challenges. I’m just as comfortable engaging with people as I am with technology, and I’m passionate about delivering solutions that make an impact.

👔 Interested in working together? Check out my resume [here](https://registry.jsonresume.org/jasonsiders).
